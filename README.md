<h3>PhD - Statistics</h3>
This experiment is part of my Statistics lecture I took as part of my Phd study.</br>
I have downloaded woodscape dataset: https://woodscape.valeo.com/woodscape/download, </br>
which is one of very few that contains annotated data for soiling</br>
Then I studied basic segmentation networks. Some of them I created from the scratch and some of them I downloaded without weights, replaced few top layers and trained them.</br>
<br>
My task was very simple. Train few networks and select the one, that seems to be best performing. For the selection I should have use statistical methods recommended by my professors.
